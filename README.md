### Yet Another Boing Ball Demo

Back to the days when real computers first emerged, and users genuinely reveled in the joy of using them. It was in 1984, at the CES trade show, that a machine was unveiled, turning the computer market upside down. The Amiga 1000, with its iconic Boing Ball demo stealing the spotlight, caused a worldwide jaw-drop. It took many years for the world to truly catch up.

The project features two core Compose components: one responsible for rendering and animating the Boing Ball on a canvas (BoingBall.kt), and another dedicated solely to drawing the background (BoingBallBackground.kt).

*(Boing Ball part is developed with AI's help â€“ I'll admit, 3D spatial mathematics isn't exactly my forte!)*
