## Yet Another Boing Ball Demo

Back in the days when real computers first emerged and users genuinely rejoiced in the joy of using them, a machine appeared that turned the computer market upside down. At the 1984 CES trade show, the Amiga 1000 was unveiled — and its now-iconic Boing Ball demo, stealing the spotlight, caused a worldwide jaw-drop. It took years for the industry to truly catch up.

This project features two core Jetpack Compose components: one responsible for rendering and animating the Boing Ball on a canvas (BoingBall.kt), and another dedicated solely to drawing the background (BoingBallBackground.kt).

*(For the Boing Ball component, I used some help from AI to handle the more complex parts of the 3D math.)*

- The original Boing Ball demo was created by RJ Mical and Dale Luck.
